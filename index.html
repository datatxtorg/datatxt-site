		<h1>Web Data Discovery</h1>
		The <a href="https://robots.txt">robots.txt</a> and <a href="https://humans.txt">humans.txt</a> files decribe a website content for web crawlers and people. In a similar way, a data.txt file descibes a website content for data discovery and access.

		A data.txt file is just a <a href="https://yaml.org/">yaml</a> file with a list of attributes that describe one or many data sources. The only required attribute is a 'path' to point to data sources available in the website, but can also include many other optional fields like 'description', 'license', 'name', and so on.
